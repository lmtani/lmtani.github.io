This is a place where I store...

**Things like:** how to make a circus image, how to make a blast server running, how to quickly assemble a small genome, etc.

**Thoughts like:**  how to manage your environment dependencies, advantages (and disadvantages) of workflow languages, creating tests, etc.

Hope people find helpful stuff in here.
